        <h2> My dog, Alfie </h2>
        <p>I love Alfie because he’s the perfect little companion who always knows how to brighten my day. His tiny size doesn’t stop him from having a huge personality—he’s full of energy, confidence, and love. No matter what, he’s always by my side, ready for cuddles or a playful chase around the house. His bark might be louder than you'd expect from a little guy, but it’s part of what makes him so endearing. Whether we’re out for walks or just curled up together on the couch, Alfie’s presence makes everything feel just a little bit better. He’s more than just a dog—he’s my best buddy.</p>
